The second season of The Eminence in Shadow was a complete rollercoaster. In the latest episodes, we’ve gone from witnessing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow absolutely obliterating Ragnarok</a> to Mordred transforming into a demon in a futile attempt to defeat Shadow.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>In the meantime, after the entire battle came to a halt, Arkane was caught and captured when she was seen at night. Naturally, Shadow quickly came to the rescue, and thus, episode 12 ended. So, what about episode 13?</p><h2 id=h-when-is-episode-13-of-the-eminence-in-shadow-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is episode 13 of The Eminence in Shadow coming out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Eminence-In-Shadow-2.jpg><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>I have some bad news for you: there is no episode 13. There never was. Despite the season ending in a ginormous plot twist, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 13 was never in the works</a> – which is surprising, considering season 1 ran for 20 whole episodes. The second season, however, was planned for 12 episodes from the start. Despite the sad news, we still have some good information on the horizon.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>A movie adaptation is being crafted as we speak. So while we’re understandably frustrated about the obvious lack of a thirteenth episode, at least we can rest assured knowing Shadow and Cid will be coming back, albeit on the silver screen. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if you’re still hoping to see even more of The Eminence in Shadow</a>, the novels are available on Yen Press.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmasmJq%2FpnnToZxmnZ2eu6a6wp5koqZdqLWisM6wZKydkai8r3mRZpypoaOksaZ5kGxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
