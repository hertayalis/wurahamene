Why haven’t you spoken about the positive things we’ve done with this platform?” the former MMA fighter asked the retired wide receiver. Lee went on to cite examples such as helping fund cancer treatment for one restaurant owner and helping a schoolteacher retire.</p><p>However, Lee even had backup - from Johnson's own daughter no less. "Listen, we team Keith Lee over here," Johnson claimed his daughter had texted him. "My daughter got on my head about this. And when your daughter get you on about something like this, you know you never gonna win," Johnson continued. Other famous daughters have also gone after Johnson.

Johnson recently revealed that in 1997, while attending Santa <a href=# class=text-word rel>Monica</a> College, he worked as a stripper to help pay his bills. “I used to strip at The Right Track, I used to be a dancer. I could tell you cause we family. 1997, I was in LA. My mom was out there but I really couldn’t live with my mama, so I had a place in Santa Monica. Sometimes I was short on my light bill. Them candles, light em. I used to strip. I used to be a dancer. If anybody in the chat is from LA that’s a little bit older, I used to strip at The Right Track. I bullsh-t you not," Johnson told a livestream back in September.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Shannon Sharpe And Chad Johnson Debate Romantic Partner Bathroom Etiquette</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-johnson-s-daughter-calls-him-out>Johnson's Daughter Calls Him Out</h2></span><p>Follow all the latest pop culture news here at HotNewHipHop.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>][<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaH55hY9mmqGZlGK3sLTNrKanZZuatrW0jKWcnmWimsCxu82dqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
