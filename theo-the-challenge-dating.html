In fact, it doesn't look like Theo is dating anyone, if we're being honest.</p><p>He did have a public breakup with fellow Challenge star Kaz Crossley, however. The pair were on Love Island UK at different times and they started dating in 2019, and their relationship lasted nearly a year. However, ahead of going on The Challenge: World Championship at the same time, they were split up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Theo Campbell suffered an eye injury in 2019.</h2><p>While on vacation in Ibiza with Kaz in August 2019, the Love Island alum got into a freak accident that changed his life forever.
