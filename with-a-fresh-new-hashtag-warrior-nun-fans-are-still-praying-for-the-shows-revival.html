Months have passed since the show was canceled, never to receive a third season, and ever since then, fans have been lobbying via social media to get the show revived. Now a new hashtag is rallying the troops as they continue to insist that, like the main character, the show be brought back to life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>The comic book adaption follows Ava Silva, a 19-year-old woman who is brought back to life after having a holy halo thrust into her body. After becoming a part of an ancient order that fights demons on Earth, she finds herself embroiled in a war between heaven and hell. The show ran for two seasons on Netflix, with the last season released on Nov. 10, 2022, but it was not long after this that the news came that Netflix was not going to continue the story, leaving the cast, crew, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans all around the world devastated</a>.</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>There has been a steady and unrelenting wave of protests from fans to get the show revived and the call to action on social media has been quite extraordinary, with petitions being signed, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">billboards erected,</a> and a number of hashtags being utilized to draw attention to the show.

Other fantasy dramas, aimed predominantly at a young female audience were also given the boot including First Kill, I Am Not Okay With This, and Dare Me, all of which featured LGBTQ+ relationships.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>Now, fans are causing the phrase ‚Äúrise bisexual warrior‚Äù to trend on Twitter in an attempt to keep the canceled show in the limelight.
