Use the air-dry or energy-saving dry options to run the dishwasher through a whole washing cycle without any interruptions. It is not necessary to use detergent. The vinegar will dissolve in the wash water.</p><p></p><h3>What is causing my dishwasher to not clean properly?</h3><p>Inadequate water in the dishwasher might also result in insufficient cleaning. If the float becomes stuck in the elevated position, the dishwasher will not be able to properly fill with water (Photo 3).
