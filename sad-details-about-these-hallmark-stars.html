We've seen shootings at schools, places of worship, movie theatres, and other public attractions. One incident hit very close to home for Tamera Mowry-Housley, whose family was met with tragedy in November 2018 when her niece,&nbsp;Pepperdine University student&nbsp;Alaina Housley, was murdered.&nbsp;</p><p>"Our hearts are broken. We just learned that our Alaina was one of the victims of last night's shooting at Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks," the "Sister, Sister" alum said in a joint statement with her husband, Adam Housley (via <a href=#>CNN</a>). "Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner." The tragic event took the lives of 11 others, and Alaina's family later set up the Alaina's Voice Foundation in her honor. "Our mission is to inspire hope and kindness in our communities through education, music, and mental health initiatives," the site states.</p><p>Mowry-Housley has become a Hallmark regular in more recent years as a featured expert on the "Home & Family" talk show and acting in five Hallmark movies, as of this writing, like "The Santa Stakeout" and "Girlfriendship." She's also continued to mourn the loss of her niece. "There are days I loop my LIVE photos just to get a glimpse of you; your spirit, your smile, your kindness,"&nbsp;Mowry-Housley shared on <a href=#>Instagram</a> in 2020. "2 years without you ... it still hurts."&nbsp;</p><p>If you have been impacted by incidents of mass violence, or are experiencing emotional distress related to incidents of mass violence, you can call or text <a href=#>Disaster Distress Helpline</a> at 1-800-985-5990 for support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmZoF2fY6smJ1llJrBorXLrGSamp%2BqwW7Ax56qnmWYlrmtucCromarpJa%2FtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
