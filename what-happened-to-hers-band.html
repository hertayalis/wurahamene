While traveling to California in March 2019 for another show, their van, which was being driven by tour manager Trevor Engelbrektson, 37, was <a href=#>hit by another vehicle traveling the wrong way</a>, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>All three men were killed in the accident, as was the other vehicle's driver, Francisco Edward Rebollar, age 63. Authorities at the scene said at the time, "There was no roadway evidence to indicate braking by either vehicle prior to impact. An alcoholic beverage container was located in the debris field."</p><p style=text-align:start>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, it was not determined if alcohol was responsible for the deadly accident.</p><p>The band's label spoke out about the loss, saying, "We are all heartbroken." The statement went on to note about Stephen and Audun, "Their energy, vibrancy and talent came to define our label."</p><p>"They were in America playing to thousands of adoring fans," Hit or Heist also said. "Fans they made a point of meeting and spending time with, such was their passion and humbleness. The world was at their feet."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i miss her's man, what a great band</p>â€” kenny.

I still listen to your albums. Rest in peace guys," someone else wrote around the same time.</p><p>In fact, dozens of fans took to the page to wish Stephen and Audun a Merry Christmas.</p><p>Meanwhile, over on X, plenty of fans who are only now discovering Her's is gone are crushed that the band never rose to the level of fame they perhaps deserved.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I feel like Herâ€™s definitely couldâ€™ve become my favorite band of all time if they hadnâ€™t passed away so soon, I canâ€™t believe they only got to release 1 album and a number of singles before their deaths.
