Whether it be slamming the cancellation of the NBC sitcom, American Auto, or a staunch response to the youth’s ignorance regarding Bob Hope, the Star Wars actor has always been one to make his grievances known. This time around, the object of his disappointment is the cancellation of the 1960s sitcom, <strong>He & She</strong> which was unceremoniously discontinued after 26 episodes.</p>Recommended Videos<p lang=en dir=ltr>GREAT show! I’m still mad they cancelled it.</p>— Mark Hamill (@MarkHamill) <a href=#>July 9, 2023</a><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Hamill, in response to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> on the subject wrote, “GREAT show! I’m still mad they canceled it.” The general consensus around Hamill’s take was one of agreement, with many fans recalling and sharing scenes with comedic effect that are still well-loved today.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>The reason for the cancellation was the sitcom’s lack of commercial success leading to an ‘unsatisfactory ratings,’ but accolades it received at the time included five Emmy nominations and one win. Those who are vigorously criticizing the move to this day emphasize how for a show to continue, popularity and high ratings are prioritized over quality.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=false>That is precisely the reason why He & She’s Journey was limited to just a few episodes as it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to live up to certain standards which determined the era’s quintessentially popular shows</a> such as the very well-known The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Danny Thomas Show, and Good Morning World, just to name a few. This is notwithstanding the progressive themes of the sitcom and the brilliant performances which it delivered, making Hamill’s tweet a rather agreeable take on the subject.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurdGkZKGZnZ65rXnIrGSsrJmhuW65wJ1kmmWjqbKtuMCrZJynnZqxunnAoZyanF2ks26106xkraGdmnqku9Slm6esXZrApK3PnmScmZ6Ysq2t06Kmp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
