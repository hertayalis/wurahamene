Have you ever read some of the labels of popular granola bars? You may be surprised what is hiding in such a so-called “healthy” granola bar! They can be full of high-fructose corn syrup, sugar, and ingredients that are so difficult to even pronounce. I love how Larabar makes bars with minimal ingredients but since they can be expensive, I wanted to create a homemade Larabar&nbsp;recipe that can easily be made at home.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tropical-Coconut-Pineapple-Macadamia-Granola-Bar-Recipe.jpg alt="Tropical Coconut Pineapple Macadamia Granola Bars. 6 Homemade Granola Energy Bars Recipes.

This bar gives you energy for hours with rolled oats, dates, almond butter, honey, coconut oil, dried cranberries, and crunchy walnuts.</p><h2>HOW TO MAKE HOMEMADE NO-BAKE GRANOLA BARS:</h2><li>&nbsp;<strong>Start with Medjool Dates.</strong> Don’t forget to remove the seed in the center! These are called “nature’s candy” for good reason. Dates keep these bars soft and moist while adding all-natural sweetness. Using a food processor breaks down the dates in no time at all.</li><li><strong>Add a Nut Butter.</strong> This gives the energy bar hearty richness. Use almond butter, all-natural peanut butter, or cashews to create a creamy granola bar.</li><li><strong>Use Rolled Oats.</strong>&nbsp; There are two options with the oats — you can either blend the oats with the dates and nut butter or stir them in after the dates, nut butter, honey, and coconut oil have been mixed in the food processor. It all depends if you want a hearty sturdier bar with the whole rolled oats or if you want them to be made into a flour-like consistency. If you blend the oats, the bars resemble more of a Larabar. If you just stir in the rolled oats, it resembles more of a granola bar.</li><li><strong>Use Honey as a Sweetener and Binder.</strong> Hello, Honey….you work wonders. I enjoy using honey in bars as it brings moisture and helps to bind the ingredients together. Honey works perfectly in these granola bars.</li><li><strong>Add Coconut Oil.</strong> We have heard of the benefits of coconut oil for years. These bars don’t need much coconut oil but it helps to keep them soft and moist.</li><li><strong>Stir in the Mix-ins.&nbsp;</strong>Add dark chocolate, dried fruits, nuts, or whatever you prefer to customize your very own bar. Once you have the base granola bar recipe down, you can make anything your heart desires!</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6-Homemade-Granola-Energy-Bars-Recipes-4.jpg alt="6 Homemade Granola Energy Bars Recipes.

I keep them in my freezer and can pull them out anytime and let them come to room temperature, about 15-20 minutes. I can also stick them in my kid’s lunch boxes for a healthy snack.</p><p>If you are looking for Healthy Smoothie Recipes, check out my <span><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>6 HEALTHY SUPERFOOD SMOOTHIE RECIPES</strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>GRANOLA BAR RECIPES:</h2><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=10861 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/6-homemade-granola-energy-bars-recipes/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=9><li id=wprm-recipe-12944-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>To make each Homemade Granola Bar Recipe:</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12944-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=6><p>Combine dates, honey, nut butter or nuts, and coconut oil in food processor or high-powered blender (such as Vitamix or Blendtec).
