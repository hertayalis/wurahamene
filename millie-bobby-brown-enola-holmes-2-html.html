The actor plays Enola’s love interest, the young Lord Tewkesbury. Someone off-screen announces that it’s a picture wrap on Louis, thus marking the end of his filming on the movie as it gets closer and closer to its debut later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The official Netflix <a href=#>Twitter</a> account revealed that Louis isn’t alone. Principal filming on Enola Holmes 2 has officially finished and the accompanying video shows Millie Bobby Brown and Louis Partridge doing a brief but jocular waltz to celebrate the occasion.&nbsp;For those unfamiliar, Millie Bobby Brown made her debut as Enola Holmes with the release of the first movie, which was based on a series of novels by Nancy Springer. The first movie was very loosely based on the first book in the seven-book franchise Enola Holmes: The Case of the Missing Marquess. As a result, many fans speculate that the second movie will see the second book, The Case of the Left-Handed Lady: An Enola Holmes Mystery, serve as the inspiration for the latest Netflix film. However, there are five more <a href=#>books</a> in the franchise that the creators behind the Netflix films could draw from, including the most recent installation in the franchise, Enola Holmes and the Black Barouche.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>While not too much is known about Enola Holmes 2, fans can be sure that there will be some familiar faces joining the mystery. In addition to Millie Bobby Brown and Louis Partridge, Helena Bonham Carter is expected to reprise her role as the Holmes family matriarch while Henry Cavill will reprise his role as the famous Sherlock Holmes to help his little sister along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Henry Cavill told <a href=#>Collider</a> in November that he had finished production on the sequel already, giving excited fans of Millie Bobby Brown’s Enola Holmes franchise something to look forward to and their first indication that the film may be arriving sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p><p>It would make sense that Netflix would want to fast-track the sequel to one of its most successful movies of 2020. In addition to giving a platform for one of its biggest stars, Millie Bobby Brown, the first movie helped the platform reach immense new heights during the pandemic. When it was released, <a href=#>IGN</a> reports that Enola Holmes was reached by 76 million members in the first four weeks of its debut, making it the fifth-biggest movie launch for the platform ever at the time. Today, movies like Red Notice and Don’t Look Up have <a href=#>broken</a> those records. That said, there’s no reason to think that a sequel to the film won’t rake in similarly high viewership for the platform and give some of its newer content a run for its money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ilmaG5qrGMm6abmqlir7O71qdknqafoa5utM6lpJ6rXWd7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
