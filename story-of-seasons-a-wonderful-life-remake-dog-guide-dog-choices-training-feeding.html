This tour is abruptly interrupted by the arrival of two cute little puppies.&nbsp;</p><p data-injection=true>Though they are both equally adorable, the man is not up for building two dog houses, so you’ll have to make a choice. <strong>Should you take the pointy-eared dog or the floppy-eared dog?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a choice you should make based on your personal preferences. <strong>It won’t affect the story or gameplay in any way</strong>. Pick whichever dog breed you like the most and give it a name.</p><h2>How to Train the Dog in Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dog-in-Story-of-Seasons-Wonderful-Life.jpg><p>Dogs in this game can perform tricks if you teach them how to do so. <strong>To teach your dog some tricks, stand near it and press the use button to see the training options</strong>.</p><p data-injection=true>The dog can learn how to jump (X), beg (Y), paw (A), and spin (L). Note that these button references are based on Nintendo Switch controls and will vary between platforms. Though it’s nice to spend time training the dog, keep in mind it’s got a stamina bar just like you. If a heart displays above your dog’s head after training, it’s happy. If you get a sweating emoji above its head, it’s time for it to get some rest.</p><h2>How to Feed the Dog in Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dog-in-Story-of-Seasons-Wonderful-Life-2.jpg><p data-injection=true>Unlike in previous games, you won’t have to meal prep for the dog. In fact, you won’t have to feed it at all. <strong>The plate next to its house will be “magically” filled every morning</strong>. You’ll find out soon enough who’s responsible for feeding your dog.</p><p>Farming enthusiasts looking for more tips and tricks can check out Gamepur’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">complete guide</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs. Throwing that useless degree out of the window, she has been writing professionally for the past three years ever since. Her passion for games dates to 2006, when she mounted a Chocobo for the first time. Under Nintendo and Square Enix's chokehold, she will willingly pour hours upon hours into reaching 100% completion in the longest roleplaying games ever made.
