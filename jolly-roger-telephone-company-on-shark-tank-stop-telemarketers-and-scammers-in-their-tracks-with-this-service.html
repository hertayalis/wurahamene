It’s a subscription service so once a new customer signs up, they can register which phone numbers they want to protect.</p><p>When an unwanted call comes in, the user can choose to merge that call with one of the Jolly Roger robots.</p><p>For those pesky repeat callers, it’s possible to set up the service so that specific callers are automatically sent to a robot, making this subscription even easier to use.</p><p>Even the robot voices are customizable so those using the service can choose which voices and scripts that they want to use for their unwanted calls. There’s a list of options located on the Jolly Roger Telephone Company website.</p><p>For those who want to see what all the buzz is about, there is a free 30 day trial for the Jolly Roger Telephone Company. After that, access costs just 99 cents per month, per phone line.</p><p>Some of the funniest phone calls recorded by this service have been shared on YouTube and for less than a dollar per month, the service just might be worth it in entertainment value alone.</p><p></p><p>Shark Tank airs on Sundays at 10/9c on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiin6G5unnRqJ6eql2psq2xz6Gmp51dmLyuvMCnsGannmLAqa3RpGStmZ6gerTAzqlkrZ2cmrqivsqeq56qo2Kur7CMrJqapZ2av7R5yKdkraCVnr9uwNGamqSrXay2tbSMrZ%2Biq12osrPCyJycaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
