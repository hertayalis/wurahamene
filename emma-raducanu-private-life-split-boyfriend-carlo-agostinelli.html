According to The Sun, it's believed that at the time of their split, Emma and her former beau unfollowed one another on Instagram.</p><p id=e_qWBIYfRyO data-wc=42>During her youth, Emma's parents introduced a 'boyfriend ban'. "My parents were very much against [boyfriends] as it interfered with training," she told The Times in May. "When I was younger I wasn't even allowed to hang out with my girl friends.</p><p id=ek2_Jn8NhgL data-wc=27>"A lot of the time I was very resentful. But it made me very confident and comfortable in my own company, which is also a big strength."</p><h2>Emma's bond with her parents</h2><p id=e8Eb5itjyZ1 data-wc=45>Emma was born in Ontario, Canada, and moved to the UK at the age of two. Her dad, Ian, is Romanian, and her mum, Renee, is Chinese. Emma grew up in Bromley which is where she learned to play tennis at a local tennis academy.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=exd3mxiSQdX data-wc=43>The British tennis hopeful has previously said that she's "lucky" to have a pushy mum and dad. Over the years her dad, Ian, has had a very hands-on approach with her career, encouraging her to take up the sport at a young age.</p><p id=e-9Zq3NhVNR data-wc=45>"They are so pushy. When I was younger more so. Now they are at a place where they tell me what they think is best, but they realise ultimately that the more they push the more I am going to resist," Emma told The Times.</p><p id=e-GqKZWyoKw data-wc=31>"So they know the smartest way is to not try to enforce their opinions but make me think it is my idea. We are three very stubborn characters in the house."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50818438f954-emma-raducanu-mother.jpg><p id=ezNMjl2HLNnl data-wc=66>She continued: "I am very grateful, and I don’t regret any of their methods. If I look at their backgrounds — I come from a diverse family, my mum is Chinese, my dad is Romanian, they both grew up in tough times and they feel you can’t afford to feel sorry for yourself, you need to be aspirational and get on with it. I inherited that."</p><h2>Her grandmother</h2><p id=ecPUBYQspTKw data-wc=42>Emma shares an incredibly close bond with her grandmother who lives in Romania. During an interview with The Independent, she shared: "My grandma, Mamiya, still lives in central Bucharest. I go back a couple times a year, stay with her, see her.</p><p id=e6IewoObNVGU data-wc=30>"It's really nice. I love the food, to be honest. I mean, the food is unbelievable. And my grandma's cooking is also something special. I do have ties to Bucharest."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
