The episode offered a glimpse into her turbulent relationship with her then-boyfriend, Derek Taylor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jordan Cashmyer and Derek Taylor parted ways after the '16 and Pregnant' episode aired.</h2><p>Jordan gave birth to her first daughter, Genevieve "Evie" Shae Taylor, on March 7, 2014. She and Derek, who fathered the child, broke up shortly after their episode of <a href=#>16 and Pregnant</a> aired on MTV.</p><p>The episode captured Jordan's attempts to find a home and secure a job after her parents disowned her, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reports.

"I was diagnosed with postpartum depression and was on medication for a little while for it, but I never followed up with my appointment. My mood wouldn't stay stable for very long. I was extremely impulsive, couldn't focus, the smallest things would set me off, and my anxiety got worse, as did my depression and OCD."</p><p>Jordan reportedly checked into rehab in the summer of 2016. She was arrested for drug possession more than once in the following year. Rumors about her working as a sex worker started to emerge in 2017, as well.</p><p>Things started to look up in January 2021 when Jordan celebrated one year of sobriety. She and her fiancé, Michael Frank Schaffer, welcomed their first and only daughter, Lyla, in June 2021.</p><p>However, Michael passed away soon after in September 2021, aged only 30.
