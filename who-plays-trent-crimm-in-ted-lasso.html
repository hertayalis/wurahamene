Out of respect for Ted, Trent notifies him when he is about to publish a scathing article about his panic attacks, and leaks his source.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Of course, this leads to Trent being fired from The Independent, only to be replaced in the AFC Richmond press room by Marcus Adebayo at the publication. We miss Trent dearly, but who exactly plays him? And will he make a return in season three?

At 48 years of age, Lance has been active in the film and television industry since the ’90s, and outside of Ted Lasso, is most prominently known for his roles in Northern Soul, Bronson, Marie Antoinette, and Bel Ami. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Lance</a> was a nominee at the 2022 Emmy Awards for his role as the enigmatic journalist in Ted Lasso in the Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series category. Lance has had many roles in both live action and voiceover, winning the Best Voice Actor award at the 2022 Overcome Film Festival in The Mountain short.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>We’re hoping to see James Lance reprise his role as Trent Crimm and find out what he’s been up to since The Independent fired him, but we’ll have to wait and see if he pops up a little later in Ted Lasso season three.
