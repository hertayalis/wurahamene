He is also the EVP of the company and ensures the product is as good as it can be. It seems Bull Ray defended Cody Rhodes as well.</p><p>As seen on this week’s episode of AEW Dynamite, Cody Rhodes squared off against Andrade El Idolo in an Atlanta Street Fight. In the final moments of the match, Cody Rhodes superplexed Andrade onto a flaming table.</p><p>This allowed Cody Rhodes to pick up the win and essentially end his feud with Andrade El Idolo. Rhodes took the brunt of the bump as he went through the flaming table while Andrade missed it.</p><p>While speaking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Busted Open Radio</a>, Bully Ray defended Cody Rhodes against fans who think Rhodes botched the flaming table spot as he said that the spot looked cool to him regardless.</p><p>“Cody took the fire, Andrade took the move. Could I say, ‘Cody should’ve never went through the table? Cody should’ve been selling more through the fire and this, and this?’ Yep, I could sit here and do that all day. Who the f*ck cares? It looked cool.”</p><p>“If Cody botched it go get a table, go get some lighter fluid, light it on fire, film it in your backyard and do it better. ‘Cody botched it. Andrade botched it.’ What did they botch? Your mother botched you at birth.”</p><p>Gruesome images of <a href=#>Cody Rhodes’ scorched back</a> were already shown recently after the conclusion of AEW Dynamite.
