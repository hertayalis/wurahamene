While they could still reunite with the showmance, Cory and America are in trouble.</p><p>Jag, Matt, Blue, Cirie, Jared, and Cameron have all mentioned that they would target Cory if they win the next Head of Household Competition.</p><p>This situation partly evolved due to Cory and America allying with Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes. Is it a real alliance? It’s possible.</p><p>Cory is the outgoing HOH, so he likely won’t play in the September 28 challenge. For him to survive, Cory needs America to win something.</p><p>If America does win, she plans to nominate the remaining zombie and Felicia.
