Every actor, musician, and well-known creative has to make a personal decision about how to handle this and what they will allow to be public knowledge. It’s a difficult balancing act, but one that actor <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Constance Wu</a></strong> handles with imperfect grace. She leans more towards keeping her private life to herself which is why not much is known about her musician boyfriend and baby daddy Ryan Kattner. Before we examine what we do know, let’s take a look back at Wu’s beginnings and her career to see why fans care so much in the first place.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-constance-wu-a-brief-bio data-injectable=false>Constance Wu: a brief bio</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Wu was born on March 22, 1982 in Richmond, Virginia to Taiwanese parents.

It was a good thing she did, because in LA she booked a breakout role that would catapult her career in 2014.

In this interview she let it slip that she owned a rabbit and when she introduced the bunny to her boyfriend, they gave their hop of approval. This made Wu believe that this unnamed boyfriend was something special.</p><p>“With my boyfriend, he was just himself when he first met my bunny, which was a while ago. He’s not really an animal person, but he’s a great person person,” Wu disclosed.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>Wu and Kattner were not officially out as a couple until the birth of their daughter in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Before Kattner, Wu was romantically linked to actor and director Ben Hethcoat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmm5%2BjwLWtzZycZq%2BlqHqju9ifqaKdnpl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
