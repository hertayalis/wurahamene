Even more, I considered it more about the dissolution of a relationship where you gave more than you gained but knowing that gaining and giving are irrelevant when you are not being yourself and are giving what "should be" therefore, gaining nothing that could sustain you because that comes from within.</p><p>Love and hate, get it wrong, she cut me right back down to size...</p><p>Love and hate are both extremes of the same spectrum of but love is often times exhonorated while hate is "wrong." He is saying that while he loved, it was deemed just as wrong and the other person never recognized all that he gave which was what he considered to be love.</p><p>"Sieze the day, let it fade, who was there to take your place? No one knows never will, mostly me but mostly you. What do you say, do you do, when it all comes down?"</p><p>To seize the day usually means to put your all into what you are "given" in life (we are not really given a thing because life is about making the best choices within our situations) and to not take for granted the moments because they are brief. To let it fade signifies that he wants to believe he put his "all" into the relationship and is realizing that he could not do this again. However, when it all comes down; when all that you knew to be certain falls down around you, you may find that what you thought you were giving was only what was expected and not from your heart. Sometimes it is within the wreckage that you finally find yourself and what it means to truly give. That cloud of realization is liberating!</p><p>"There is no blame only shame, when you beg you just complain. The more I come the more I try, please don't be so paranoid."</p><p>You then realize that "begging" is shameful in that you are essentially begging when you are trying to please someone because this, in turn, is like asking for acceptance when you are sacrificing more than you should...fake. As in trying to gain approval by not truly being yourself and accepted for who you are rather than be original and "take it or leave it" in a relationship. When this cloud of fog has settled upon he ground, it becomes very difficult to rise above it, unless, that is, the fog of a relationship coming down around it where you may see that clouds belong in the sky! No more begging, complaining, loving or hating but simply being yourself! Liberation!</p><p>"So am I so's the future so are we to teach the creature. What do you say, do you do when it all comes down?"</p><p>Paranoia is equivalent to worry of outcomes and weighing every possibility without direction. That is easy to do when trying to peer into the great unknown when you've lived certain about your future. Those who depend on their mind-scales never realize how swiftly the balance can teeter-tot when you are not sure what it is you are weighing anymore, but it is within the lack of weight and worry that you find that only you are the center with hands reached out, weighing each odd.</p><p>Anywho, this song is about taking back your life from none other than yourself and reclaiming what it means to balance what you get and what you give. No drugs unless it involves the accronym, D.A.R.E.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZputo518pLvMnpuor54%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
