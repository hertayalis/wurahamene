The lyrics express the desire to see the person again and to be able to touch their skin, but ultimately accepting that the relationship is over and they have to move on. The chorus talks about how the person was taken to Chanel and Cartier, but eventually left and won't be coming back. The song acknowledges that mistakes were made in the relationship, but they can't be fixed and the two people have to go their separate ways. Despite this, the singer still loves the person and will remember them forever.</p><p>Becky G is a Mexican-American singer, songwriter, and actress from Inglewood, California.
