Harold died on the battlefield and is believed to have been so wounded in battle that only his wife could identify his remains (via <a href=#>The History Jar</a>). William the Conquerer, who became king in December of that year, is said to have not wanted there to be a shrine to honor the fallen Harold and the exact location of his remains are still a mystery. Some speculate that only his heart was buried in Essex.</p><p dir=ltr>William the Conqueror claimed Christian control over the English lands that he invaded on behalf of Pope Alexander II (via <a href=#>Christianity.com</a>). He died in Normandy, France, and while attempting a Christian burial of the king, it is said his funeral attendants botched the ceremony in&nbsp;the Abbey of Saint-Étienne (via <a href=#>Berkhamsted Castle</a>). Apparently, his corpse exploded from an effort to shove his body into too small of a coffin, and the church was left with a pungent smell as a result. Historians believe this unfortunate turn of events allowed for looting and desecrating of the remains which might have led to stricter burial practices and/or guidelines (via <a href=#>Historic UK</a>).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j2poa2tnZMSpxYyrprKZnKh6r7HVnqlmoJGrsm67z56lZpuRqLimwNJmm66qmaO0brLUp5yrmZyofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
