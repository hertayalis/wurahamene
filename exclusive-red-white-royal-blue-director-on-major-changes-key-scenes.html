The classic enemies-to-lovers trope was given a fresh spin in Casey's beloved book but Matthew admits that his version is "very similar and also simultaneously very different," telling <strong>HELLO!:&nbsp;</strong><strong>"</strong>I know that's probably a controversial thing to say but it wouldn't have served the story very well [to be 100% faithful.]"&nbsp;</p><p id=e5sieTnkYOD data-wc=29>For <strong>HELLO!,&nbsp;</strong>Matthew breaks down seven key moments beloved by fans, including Alex and Henry's first on-screen meeting and why there would be no film without Nick and Taylor.&nbsp;</p><p id=eidpMbitlw- data-wc=2><strong></strong></p><h2>Alex and Henry's First Meeting:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7abc3def8075-rwrb2022ut220626prijon09326rc3000.jpg><p id=e7jKVt9wle data-wc=73>Alex and Henry first met at the fictional Melbourne Climate Conference several years before the film begins, but on screen we see them reuniting at the wedding of Prince Philip (Thomas Flynn), Henry's older brother, and his bride-to-be Martha (Bridget Benstead). The scene begins with Alex and friend Nora (Rachel Hilson) standing on the receiving line as Prince Philip and Martha, and later Henry and sister Princess Beatrice (Ellie Bamber) greet the guests.&nbsp;</p><p id=er1eBHah-D data-wc=27>But Matthew reveals that <strong>their first meeting on-screen was originally going to be in front of the cake,</strong> before he realized the audience would need more context.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8BKLFHAUx data-wc=56>"The initial meeting on screen was when they met up in front of the cake but I realized watching the film that I needed to introduce and create a sense of animosity between them earlier and so that's how the receiving line scene came about," shares Matthew. These additional scenes were then completed in January 2023.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5549b07227c1-rwrb-henry-president.jpg><p id=eeSPv7ULgb data-wc=30>The receiving line scene is also a wonderful example of the wildness Taylor brings to the screen as Alex, something that Matthew says he never needed to coach Taylor on.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMOcZnHQI7 data-wc=59><strong>"Taylor brought a lot of that chaotic energy himself from the beginning</strong>, but what was remarkable was that as I was working with Taylor, I started to see that this actually is not who he is; Taylor in reality, while a very gregarious, open and warm person is quieter, and sometimes a little shyer – very much not Alex."</p><p id=eRt4PwUNqh data-wc=21>Casting for the film began in 2021 over Zoom meetings, but Matthew says the chemistry between Taylor and Nicholas was "instantaneous".</p><p id=e2pIKNp7OS data-wc=52>"When we put them together in a chemistry read - and we did it on Zoom because everybody was in different cities at the time - it was instantaneous.

"Casey said to me after watching it for the second or third time, 'It's like there's my book, and then there's your movie and the two are very, very similar and also very different,' which is good because if the movie was so faithful to the book, it, I don't even think it would please the fans of the book.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1sqfYXa0Tg data-wc=18>"I know that's probably a controversial thing to say but it wouldn't have served the story very well."</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Best LGBTQ romance novels that are a must-read</h3><ul><li>What If It's Us - Becky Albertalli and Adam Silvera</li><li>In at the Deep End - Kate Davies</li><li>The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue - Mackenzi Lee</li><li>One Last Stop - Casey McQuiston</li><li>Conventionally Yours - Annabeth Albert&nbsp;</li><li>Tipping the Velvet - Sarah Waters</li><li>Heartstopper - Alice Oseman</li><li>Cemetery Boys - Aiden Thomas<br></li><li>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo - Taylor Jenkins Reid</li><li>The Charm Offensive - Alison Cochrun</li><li>Leah on the Offbeat - Becky Albertalli</li><li>The Song of Achilles - Madeline Miller</li><li>Red, White and Royal Blue - Casey McQuiston</li><li>Boyfriend Material - Alexis Hall</li><li>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe - Benjamin Alire Sáenz</li></ul><p id=ePhvTW41kC data-wc=41>He continues: "I needed to observe the logic of a film and trust that I had internalized the emotional truths of the book and the Storming of Kensington in the book is a lot more chaotic and Alex is highly charged.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRLulkMDMv data-wc=70>"When we were in rehearsals, and Taylor and Nick and I began to really delve into that scene, <strong>we realized quickly that if Alex came on that strong then Henry, given where he is mentally, would simply say, 'well, get out,'&nbsp;</strong>and kick Alex out. So we knew implicitly that we needed to do a different version of that scene, one in which Alex isn't at all certain of success.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIy3D_19wv data-wc=73>"In the book, Alex is willing to burn down the castle in order to get what he wants, and although the scene actually uses a lot of dialogue from the book, our Alex in the film knows that if this doesn't work, their relationship is over. So he's a little more careful with Henry, more fearful, and Henry is more heartbroken, and those decisions really determined everything else that followed in the scene."&nbsp;</p><h2>Alex and Henry's first date in Paris:&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/840c718e0e91-1264685367ca3fab04bf4895acb2998cb0287e2cmaster.jpg><p id=eErtUF0G7H data-wc=23>Alex and Henry's first date is in Paris, France, and it was also the first day of filming for the cast and crew.&nbsp;</p><p id=evdMHyUjAX data-wc=57>"I remember thinking it was a perfect scene to start with because<strong>&nbsp;Alex and Henry are a bit nervous with each other as it's their first date and they're trying to present in the world as just two friends&nbsp;</strong>having lunch together in Paris, but the truth is they're on their first date and they're very nervous.&nbsp;</p><p id=ez2H608AOI data-wc=81>"It was my first day filming as a filmmaker ever while Taylor and Nick had just spent two weeks rehearsing with each other and were just getting to know each other well. In Sidney Lumet's book on filmmaking he says something along the lines of, 'your first day of filming can be somewhere in the middle of the movie because the actors don't quite know who they are yet and that's okay because the audience is still figuring it out too'."&nbsp;</p><h2>The changing of Henry's name:&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/476adc9167db-12646852dc6c057723a646a1831f41d1fc45d289master.jpg><p id=edKcWD8owu data-wc=39><strong>Henry George Edward James Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor&nbsp;</strong>is Prince Henry's full name in the book, but Matthew made the decision to change Henry's last name on screen to Fox-Hanover-Stewart, simply because Mountchristen-Windsor was too closely associated with the real British royals.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJE9_yBMLt data-wc=78>The scene comes during Henry and Alex's first date in Paris, but Matthew shares that it was a simple directorial decision: "Before we even started to get into rehearsals, Nick and I were talking and I decided I didn't want the audience to think about the actual British Royals. If people are watching this film and they're thinking about the Windsors, then it would have taken them out of the film, and it would have broken the fairytale."</p><h2>Zahra discovers Henry in Alex's hotel room:&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/32b8bb75d4ed-126468299ffe99e0bf054a35888c0c45b8bb6af0master.jpg><p id=e6YOofZkic data-wc=42><strong>Sarah Shahi is arguably the MVP of this film.&nbsp;</strong>As Zahra Bankston, she plays President Claremont's Deputy Chief of Staff who is tasked with handling Alex and Henry's fake friendship before famously discovering them together the morning after the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEga78qITG data-wc=44>The scene is played beautifully as Zahra at first believes Alex has welcomed a woman into his hotel room, only to realize that it is, in fact, Prince Henry – and that the pair have not been particularly ept at keeping their romance quiet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02c433abc82f-rwrb-zahra.jpg><p id=eIrdy7CGow data-wc=82>Sarah plays the scene for laughs, and Matthew shares that there is one moment that was all Sarah: "She didn't ad-lib too much, but for her it was about filling the space, like when she's moving through the room – checking out the wardrobe, I told her to look behind the sofa, – and then as she was moving from space to space I told her to say whatever she felt she wanted to fill that time, and Taylor responded in kind.&nbsp;</p><p id=eECohuww7O data-wc=51>"But <strong>that mini panic attack? I did not know I would be getting that from her on the day;</strong> I didn't tell her to do that! And when Taylor is like, 'Oh, there, you want to sit there?', at that moment he was just responding to Sarah collapsing on the bed."&nbsp;</p><h2>The Victoria and Albert Museum:&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eb91f96bf44f-rwrb2022ut220805prijon30820rc3000.jpg><p id=esTzNIMwq5 data-wc=45>Fans of the book know that the Victoria and Albert Museum plays a large role itself in the book; it is Prince Henry's safe place, where he takes Alex and reveals he had always dreamed of taking a loved one there for a private showing.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6pZCPtBnC data-wc=48>In the film, as in the book, the pair dance together here as they vow to make their relationship work, come what may.
