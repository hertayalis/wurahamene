For example, traditionally in Cataluna and Valencia, many people wear engagement rings on their left hand. But people wear engagement rings on their right in Madrid and the rest of Spain. Most people in Spain wear their wedding ring on their right hand."</p><p id=eqVzW-iSaWd data-wc=88>Gemma – who recently welcomed her second baby Thiago in July 2023, following Mia's birth in 2019 – opened up about her potential wedding plans in 2022. On the "stress" of wedding planning, she<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;told HELLO!</a>: "We have spoken about getting married a few times, talking about what we want to do. Half the time we say should just go to the registry office and do it there, and then it's done, then have a big party.
