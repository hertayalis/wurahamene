Kyle, on the other hand, wanted to move on so she could keep her relationship with Kathy on the right track.</p><p>One of the main reasons why Kyle wanted to quash the matter quickly was because, when the sisters aren't on speaking terms, it affects the rest of her family members.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>As flashbacks from past seasons showed, Kyle's prior disagreement with Kathy meant that she wasn't invited to Nicky Hilton Rothschild's 2015 wedding to James Rothschild, nor were two of her daughters.</p><p>Because Kyle's eldest daughter, Farrah Aldjufrie (who goes by Farrah Brittany on Instagram) is currently engaged to Alex Manos, Kyle wanted to make sure that she was on good terms with Kathy so Kathy's family will attend the upcoming nuptials.</p><p>"My daughter's getting married. I want everyone at the wedding," Kyle told co-star Garcelle Beauvais at her Birkins and Bubbles party.</p><p>Since Kyle brought up Farrah's wedding and the potential issue with the guest list, some RHOBH fans may be wondering if the reality star's daughter tied the knot in the months following filming.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is Farrah Aldjufrie's wedding?</h2><p>When viewers first met Farrah (who is Kyle's only daughter from her marriage to Guraish Aldjufrie) on Season 1 of RHOBH, she was celebrating her graduation from the University of Southern California.</p><p>In the decade-plus since fans first got to know Farrah, Kyle's eldest has become a real estate agent who works at The Agency, and she's now set to wed Beverly Hills businessman Alex Manos.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Farrah Brittany (@farrahbritt)</a></p></figure><p>The pair announced their engagement shortly after Thanksgiving Day (and right after her cousin, Paris Hilton, wed Carter Reum) in 2021.</p><p>Farrah's mom did discuss the upcoming nuptials on Season 12 of RHOBH, but Farrah has yet to officially tie the knot.
