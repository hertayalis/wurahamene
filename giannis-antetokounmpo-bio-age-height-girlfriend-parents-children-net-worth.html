He is a Greek-American because he is the son of immigrants from Nigeria.</p><p>His parents had left Lagos three years prior, leaving their firstborn son, Francis, in the custody of his grandparents. In Sepolia, an area of Athens, Giannis grew up.</p><p>Giannis and his older brother Thanasis sold watches, purses, and sunglasses in the streets to support their parents, who struggled to obtain employment due to their immigration status.</p><p>Giannis began playing basketball in 2007. Despite the fact that Giannis and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically acquire Greek citizenship because of the jus sanguinis system used by that country.</p><p>Adetokunbo was virtually stateless for the first 18 years of his life, unable to leave the country and lacking any documentation from either Greece or Nigeria. Less than two months before the 2013 NBA Draft, on May 9, 2013, he was finally granted Greek citizenship.</p><p>His surname officially changed to “o” once he was granted Greek citizenship in 2013, which is the Greek transliteration of Adetokunbo. This name was then transliterated letter-for-letter and written as Antetokounmpo on his Greek passport.</p><p>Giannis is a slang term for the Greek name Ioannis (John). His last name was difficult for many people to say, therefore he immediately earned the nickname “Greek Freak”. Antetokounmpo has dual citizenship as he is also a citizen of Nigeria, having obtained his Nigerian passport in 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Giannis Antetokounmpo age</h2><p>Giannis was born in 1994.
