Today, St. John is making headlines as it was revealed that he was charged with a federal indictment as announced by </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston</span></a><span>. According to the indictment, St. John was part of a scheme that allegedly “</span><span>executed a scheme to defraud lenders and the Small Business Administration’s (SBA's) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)”. These programs were put in place to support Americans and businesses as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. St. John and his affiliates had allegedly “fraudulently obtained at least 16 loans and at least $3.5 million.</span><span>”</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to the indictment, the scheme was led by Micheal Hill and Andrew Morgan.

Instead, the defendants typically paid Hill and Moran, transferred money to their personal accounts, and spent the funds on various personal purchases,” said Featherston.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>St. John was set to make an appearance at the comic book convention, Des Moines Con in Iowa this weekend.
