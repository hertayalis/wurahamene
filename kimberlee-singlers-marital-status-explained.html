According to <a href=#>AP News</a>, Singler’s 11-year-old daughter was hospitalized in the attack, and Singler’s marital status is relevant to the case.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>On Dec. 19, 2023, Singler reported there had been a burglary in her home, causing the deaths of her two children and the injury of her surviving daughter, Singler said. Singler also had minor injuries. Colorado police were reportedly ready to arrest Singler for what happened when she disappeared from Colorado Springs around Dec. 23, 2023. Over the New Year’s holiday weekend, Singler was apprehended in London without incident.</p><h2 id=h-singler-and-her-ex-husband-were-fighting-over-custody data-injectable=false>Singler and her ex-husband were fighting over custody</h2><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>When Kimberlee Singler allegedly killed two of her children and injured a third, she was reportedly in a yearslong, bitter custody battle with her estranged husband, <a href=#>Kevin Wentz</a>. According to Colorado news outlet <a href=#>Denver 7</a>, Singler filed for divorce from Wentz in 2018, and about a year later, Singler sought in court to limit how much time Wentz could spend with his children.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>In Jan. 2021, Singler sought to gain sole custody of her children and move them to Florida, which Wentz fought in an “abduction prevention hearing.” Shortly before Singler and Wentz’s children were attacked and killed, Singler was ordered to deliver her three children to a prearranged location for visitation with their father. Not long afterward, Singler reported the burglary.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Singler accused Wentz of “felony menacing” in the past involving a knife, court documents said. A court in Colorado reportedly ruled that Wentz would not “endanger their [children’s] physical health or impair their emotional development.” When her two children died, and one was injured, Singler and Wentz still disagreed over custody, and their divorce was not final.</p><h2 id=h-wentz-is-devastated data-injectable=false>Wentz is “devastated”</h2><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>With his estranged wife, Kimberlee Singler, in custody, Kevin Wentz said through his lawyer he was devastated by what happened and that he and his family were in “a tremendous amount of grief and shock” (via BBC). After Wentz’s 11-year-old daughter received medical treatment for her injuries, she was allowed to leave the hospital.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=750 data-injectable=false>Singler’s charges include four counts of felony murder in the first degree, two counts of felony attempted murder, three counts of felony child abuse, and one count of felony assault in the first degree, <a href=#>ABC News</a> reports. On Jan. 2, 2024, the <a href=#>BBC</a> said that Singler, who was 35, had appeared in an English court for an extradition hearing. She was expected to be back in court in late January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6C2rq7Eq6OenV2otq%2Bzy56prGWdlr%2BqwMClZKyskanCtHnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
