Her grudge against pirates stems from the Red-Hair Pirates abandoning her in Elegia after destroying the country. Uta, driven by resentment, devises a plan to capture everyone attending her concert into a fictional reality using her Sing-Sing Fruit powers. In a critical moment, she faces a dilemma: to maintain her powers, she must continuously consume Wake-shrooms, at the cost of one’s life once they stop eating them. Despite Shanks offering a life-saving medicine, Uta rejects it, choosing to sacrifice herself by singing to free others from the Sing-Sing Fruit’s world. The movie concludes with Uta tragically dying, her coffin draped with a flag as the Red-Hair Pirates sail away. While her death is strongly implied, the certainty remains unconfirmed until addressed in the main series by the author, Eiichiro Oda.</p><p>TRENDING</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
