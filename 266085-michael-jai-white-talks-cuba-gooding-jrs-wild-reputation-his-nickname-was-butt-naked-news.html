Cuba has come forward to adamantly deny the accusations against him while the court of public opinion rakes him through the coals.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Michael said he "not surprised" by the accusations, but "Cuba's a wild boy, that's never been hidden." The actor added that Cuba would tell everyone <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">that his nickname was "Butt Naked" because "for 20 years </a>he just would drop [trousers] in public. He did that a lot." White stressed that Cuba has called himself that, "so that's something nowadays is completely frowned upon, so when I say I'm not surprised, it's not because he's a lecherous person. I just think people are... They're on a witchhunt for it, to some degree."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">White claims<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> he's never been drunk but he recognizes that it can cause people to do things</a> they may regret. Because Cuba likes to drink and party, his "wild" antics were apart of "how he was fun." Although White can't say anything about whether or not Cuba has crossed the line with anyone, he can say that he never heard about anyone complaining back in the day.
