The pair have finally started to bond, but they have found themselves in a spot of bother in Kansas City.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>While fans of the original game were treated to the road trip scene featuring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hank Williams’ “Alone and Forsaken”</a> playing out pretty much exactly as it did in the 2013 Naughty Dog title, there is a little bit of disappointment floating around regarding the absence of a scene which should have happened by this point in the show’s narrative.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>It is, of course, the dreaded, and intense bloater pursuit sequence (with plenty of clickers to boot) in the basement of the hotel in Pittsburgh, after Joel falls down an elevator shaft and needs to start up a generator to find his way out.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>There are a few things to unpack here – for starters, the scene in which Joel and Ellie happen upon a swanky hotel already happened in episode two, ‘Infected’. Secondly, the game sequence in question happens before Joel and Ellie <a href=#>meet their captors at the end of this week’s episode</a>. This seems to point toward the showrunners opting to skip over this side story.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>However, there could also be a reasonable explanation for the absence of the game’s most (perhaps out of place?) tense and harrowing sequence. After all, the show’s trailer revealed that we’ll be coming face to face with a bloater one way or another.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the most likely explanation is that showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann opted to sideline a bloater encounter until a more fitting moment in the series, seeing as this week’s episode gave a lot of focus to building the foundations of Joel and Ellie’s relationship. Thinking of things in TV terms, Joel running around in a dank basement with a Bloater for five to ten minutes would’ve been a bit of an odd sideshow.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Still, hope is wearing thin after seeing all of the ingredients for the game’s most horrifying set piece combined – an elevator shaft, a wet basement, a generator, hordes of clickers, and a bloater. Perhaps the network thought it was just a bit too scary an inclusion for what is mostly a drama series.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=false>We’ll just have to wait and find out when The Last of Us returns to HBO Max this Friday, in a special time slot to dodge the Super Bowl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yprs6sZK2glWK5or%2FTZqafZaWoeq6t2Gafmq6VYre2v9Nmo56epGK8tsCMrZ%2BeZZeWuqa%2FjKamrKxdnbyzvsifsKKml2K6sLnEp6to</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
