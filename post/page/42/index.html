TMZ reports that Mitchell, who's known for her portrayal of Eazy-E in Straight Outta Compton, stirred up some drama on a Delta flight.

Tommie Smith (born June 6, 1944) is a former American track and field athlete who went on to play wide receiver in the American Football League. Smith won the 200-meter dash finals and the gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics in 19.83 seconds, breaking the legal 20-second barrier for the first time.
